# math-generator
A Python application for generating math problems for students, tutors and teachers.
By making an easy way to generate math problems, I hope to give students extra problems to work through for different concepts with which they're struggling. The program will initially only be for students of grades K-12, but as I dive deeper into coding, I hope to cover more fields of math. This program will NOT include math subjects that are based around real world data or word problems, such as statistics.
